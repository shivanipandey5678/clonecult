                    <h3>Lab tests At home</h3>
                    <p>Lab tests are essential not just to help the doctor detect a condition or a disease, but are also important to plan the treatment, monitor its efficacy, and switch it if it is not helping you the way it should. They may be advised by the doctor to detect certain specific conditions or as a part of a routine checkup. Until a few years ago, getting lab tests to check the samples of our blood, tissue, or urine to get a diagnosis of diseases or other conditions used to be done at hospitals or clinics. This used to have its own share of stress, costs, and other concerns. However, due to several innovations in diagnostic healthcare, things like telemedicine and home diagnostic tests are a reality. Home testing services have been possible due to the advancements in laboratory technology, growth and penetration of the internet, the birth of inventive health-tech startups, and the fact that people are becoming more cognizant of their health and ordering these tests and health checkup at home. Not only are these lab tests at home simple, systematic, have a quick turnaround time, but also 100 percent accurate. Depending on the service that you choose, home diagnostic tests can be done at ourselves at home or by experienced phlebotomists who come to collect the samples at home.</p>
