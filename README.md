# Cult Fit Clone

This is the very first project of my life, a clone of the Cult Fit website. This static website includes working Home, Lab, and Care pages, designed primarily for larger viewports. The site features a little scroll animation and is built using plain HTML and CSS.

## Features
- Home, Lab, and Care pages
- Static website design
- Optimized for larger viewports
